# customer-churn-intelligence-system
A simple machine learning project using Logistic Regression and Flask to classify customer churn risk.
Overview

This project uses a Logistic Regression model to classify customer churn risk and a Flask web app to interact with the trained model.

The focus of this project is learning the end-to-end flow:
data → model → web interface.

Tech Stack

Python
Logistic Regression (scikit-learn)
Flask
Pandas
Joblib

What I Worked On
Training a basic classification model
Saving and loading the trained model
Integrating the model with a Flask web application
Passing input data from frontend to backend and displaying predictions

Notes

This project was built as part of my learning process in machine learning and Flask.
It focuses on understanding fundamentals rather than optimizing performance.
